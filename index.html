        Project Management Professional in Sustainability & Renewable Energy<br>
        Experience across ESG consulting and large-scale wind and solar projects

      <h2>Professional Profile</h2>

      <p>
        I am a project management professional with a background in sustainability and renewable energy, combining structured analytical thinking with a strong focus on communication, coordination, and delivery.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hold an M.Sc. in Physics, which provides a solid technical and analytical foundation for managing complex projects. My core strength, however, lies in project leadership at the human interface: creating alignment between stakeholders, facilitating clear decision-making, and ensuring that projects move forward from planning to execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        After two years in climate change–related ESG consulting at KPMG in Berlin, I deliberately transitioned into project management and project development roles in the renewable energy sector. In these roles, I worked on large-scale wind and solar projects and particularly valued taking ownership, coordinating multidisciplinary teams, and navigating technical, regulatory, and commercial dependencies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond my formal professional roles, I have repeatedly taken on project responsibility in non-corporate settings. Over the past three years, I founded and grew a beach volleyball community from a small group of around 20 people into a network of more than 1,000 participants. I organized recurring large-scale events, managed logistics and communication, and ultimately developed the initiative into a small side business. This experience closely mirrors core project management tasks such as planning, stakeholder engagement, risk handling, and long-term ownership.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a trained mediator, which strongly informs my project management approach, particularly in situations involving conflicting interests or high coordination effort. I value clarity, frankness, and dependability, and I am motivated by roles that require responsibility, empathy, and a focus on delivering results.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently preparing to relocate to Zurich, Switzerland, and am seeking project management roles in the renewable energy sector or adjacent areas of the green economy.
